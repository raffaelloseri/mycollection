Yōshū Chikanobu (1838-1912) [ARTIST]. Edo/Tokyo print designer and painter. Also Hashimoto  Chikanobu. Born into a samurai family in Echigo Province; he studied Kanō painting before going to Edo, where he studied with Utagawa Kuniyoshi, Utagawa Kunisada and Toyohara Kunichika, producing prints by the 1860s. He established himself as an artist of manners and customs in the 1880s with triptychs of the Meiji Emperor and Empress, and members of the court dressed in typically Victorian attire (see <em>kaika-e</em>). He is recognized for these works and <em>bijinga</em> prints in an increasingly sublime palette such as the 1897 series <em>True Beauties</em> (<em>Shin bijin</em>) and <em>Mirror of Ages</em> (<em>Jidai kagami</em>). A versatile artist, he also designed war triptychs of the Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and some <em>yakusha-e</em>; he also exhibited work in the Domestic Competitive Painting Exhibition (<em>Naikoku Kaiga Kyōshinkai</em>) of 1882. Other <em>gagō</em>: Ikkakusai, Yoshitsuru II. (Newland, 2005, v. 2, p. 497)
