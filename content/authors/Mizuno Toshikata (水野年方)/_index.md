Mizuno Toshikata (1866-1908) [ARTIST]. Tokyo print designer, illustrator and painter. As a boy, studied with Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, but was withdrawn, then studied Western-style drawing and pottery painting with Yamada Ryūtō. He eventually returned to Yoshitoshi's studio, and trained in the preparation of <em>hanshita-e</em>. Upon Yoshitoshi's recommendation, he became a staff illustrator for the newspaper <em>Yamato shinbun</em>. He also studied literati (Nanga) painting with Shibata Hōshū, <em>kachōga</em> with Watanabe Seitei and <em>hanshita-e</em> with Mishima Shōsō (1856-1928); he was also designated by Yoshitoshi as his successor, thereby becoming a standard-bearer for late 19-th c. nishiki-e. He made numerous triptychs of the sino-japanese war (1894-95), frontispieces (see <em>kuchi-e</em>) for contemporary novels, and several sets and series of prints including two sets on fashions for Mitsui Department Store (in 1898, and in 1905-6 after the name was changed to Mitsukoshi). As a leading <em>ukiyo-e</em> painter of customs and manners and a serious history painter, he did much to equalize the status of the Ukiyo-e school with the Tosa and Shijō schools [...] Other <em>gagō</em>: Shōsetsu.
